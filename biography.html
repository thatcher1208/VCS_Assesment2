<section><h1>BIOGRAPHY</h1><p>Pennywise was formed in 1988 in Manhattan Beach, California, by singer Jim Lindberg,
 guitarist Fletcher Dragge, drummer Byron McMackin and bassist Jason Thirsk. They released two EPs 
 A Word from the Wise and Wildcard (both 1989). Each of the band members had played in other bands 
 in the Hermosa Beach area and attended Mira Costa High School, except for McMackin, who attended 
 Redondo Union High School. The group signed to Epitaph Records in 1990 and released their first 
 album Pennywise (1991). The album quickly circulated throughout the punk community, earning the
 band some nationwide recognition. Lyrics in the album endorsed a positive mental attitude, helping
 promote progressive ideals for Generation X. Lindberg left the band soon after the debut record. 
 In 1992, The Vandals lead singer Dave Quackenbush took over on vocals for a brief stint to help 
 with touring. Bradbury left the band and Thirsk returned to bass.</p>

<p>Lindberg got married and returned to the group in 1992 in time for their second album Unknown Road,
released in August 1993, an underground hit that established the band as a force in punk music. 
While the album did not chart on the Billboard 200, it gained Pennywise supporting slots on national
and world tours with bands such as The Offspring. It contained 13 tracks and one hidden track, "Slowdown".
About Time, Pennywise's third studio album, was released on June 13, 1995. It was their first album 
to chart on the Billboard 200, ranking 96. It also charted 55 on the Australian Album Chart, 
and produced one single "Same Old Story". This was also the last album to feature Jason Thirsk 
playing bass throughout. In 1996, Pennywise began recording their fourth album. Thirsk left the 
band in an attempt to conquer his alcoholism. While initially successful, he relapsed and died 
from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the chest on July 29, 1996. Their following album, 
Full Circle, was dedicated to his memory. </p>
