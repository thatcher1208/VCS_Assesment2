<article><p>Between their 1991 self-titled debut and 2005's The Fuse, Pennywise released
 an album every two years on Epitaph Records, a label owned by Bad Religion guitarist
 Brett Gurewitz. To date, the band has released twelve full-length studio albums, one
 live album, two EPs and one DVD. Although their first two studio albums were critically
 acclaimed, Pennywise would not experience worldwide commercial success until the 1995 
 release of their third studio album, About Time, which peaked at number ninety-six 
 on the Billboard 200, and number fifty-five on Australia's ARIA Charts. The band's 
 mainstream success coincided with a growing interest in punk rock during the 1990s,
 along with fellow California bands NOFX, Rancid, Blink-182, Bad Religion, Green Day,
 The Offspring, Lagwagon and Sublime. By 2007, the band had independently sold over 
 three million records worldwide.<p></article>
